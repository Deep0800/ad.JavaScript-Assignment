What is promises?

In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous code more effectively compared to traditional callbacks.

Hereâ€™s a basic breakdown of how promises work:

Creation: A promise is created using the Promise constructor, which takes a function called the "executor." This function receives two arguments: resolve and reject.

States: A promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
Rejected: The operation failed.
Handling Results: Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, you handle the result using the then and catch methods:

then(onFulfilled, onRejected): Handles the fulfilled result or the error. It returns a new promise, so you can chain then calls.
catch(onRejected): Handles only the rejected case. It's essentially a shorthand for then(null, onRejected).
