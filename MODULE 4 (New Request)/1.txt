What is JSON?

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application as text.

Ex;
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": ["Math", "Science"],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown"
  }
}
